## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was great for me to upgrade my Flexbox skills.

I learned to change the color of a svg-image using filter: brightness(0) invert(1);

```css
.white-logo {
  filter:  brightness(0) invert(1);
}
```

### Continued development

In the next project I'm gonna use Grid as it's not as easy for me to use as Flexbox.
